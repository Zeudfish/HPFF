**HPFF**: Hierarchical Locally Supervised Learning with Patch Feature Fusion
========
PyTorch training code and pretrained models for **HPFF**.We use HPFF to optimize the Local-learning auxiliary network and achieve higher performance than E2E.

**What it is**. In this paper, published in ECCV 2024, HPFF is presented as a general method that can be applied to any Local-learning network. After applying the HPFF method, the Local-learning network is proved to have better performance than the E2E network and can reduce the GPU memory overhead by 50%.
